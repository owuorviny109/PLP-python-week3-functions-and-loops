Discount Calculator
This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

How It Works
The user enters the price of an item.

The user enters the discount percentage (must be between 0 and 100).

If the discount is 20% or more, it applies the discount; otherwise, the original price is returned.

The final price is displayed.
